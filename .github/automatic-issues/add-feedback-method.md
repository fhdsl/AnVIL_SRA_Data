To help users report issues or areas of improvement for your course, you should provide a clear method of feedback for your users to route their concerns through.

A feedback method (Google Form) has already been provided for AnVIL and GDSCN courses. When users give you feedback they can enter the name of your course. You can make it easier for them by adding the course to form:

- [ ] Add your course name here: https://forms.gle/AK12iVXTjsB7yCUUA.

[See these instructions](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Set-up-feedback-method) for more suggestions on how to add a feedback method for this course.
