Learn more about AnVIL by visiting https://anvilproject.org or reading the article in Cell Genomics. About SRA This module will go over how to bring Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data into AnVIL. You can check out the SRA website to learn more: Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data, available through multiple cloud providers and NCBI servers, is the largest publicly available repository of high throughput sequencing data. The archive accepts data from all branches of life as well as metagenomic and environmental surveys. SRA stores raw sequencing data and alignment information to enhance reproducibility and facilitate new discoveries through data analysis. It can be very exciting to learn how much data is at your fingertips! Once you have settled on some data to use, you’ll want to bring it into AnVIL if it’s not already there. Navigate to the menu on the left to get started!

This data comes from this BioProject, which collected soil samples to study bacterial communities in tallgrass prairie. Bacteria play an important role in this ecosystem, but can be changed by disturbance, management, and the presence of herbivores. The SRA Data corresponding to this project is located here. 1.1 Clone Clone the Workspace https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-outreach/SRA-data-on-AnVIL. For this demo, we have given the cloned Workspace the name SRA-data-on-AnVIL-example. 1.2 Set Up Samples Navigate to the WORKFLOWS Tab and select the SRA_Fetch Workflow. Select “Run workflow(s) with inputs defined by data table”. Set the “Select root entity type” to “sample” and click SELECT DATA. On the Select Data popup, select only the first sample, SRR22375322, and click OK. 1.3 Launch Workflow Click on the space underneath “Attribute” and select this.sample_id. Click SAVE. You are ready to launch the Workflow! Click RUN ANALYSIS. Voilà! Your Workflow is running. Because the Workflow is happening in the cloud, you can close your browser or shut down your computer without interrupting the transfer. 1.4 Check Workflow Click on the JOB HISTORY tab. You should see that the job status is “Done”. This might take a few minutes. 1.5 Locate Data Click on the DATA tab and click on the “Files” folder on the bottom left. You should see a folder submissions/. Click on: submissions/ the folder corresponding to the Submission ID you just ran. Example: c247972a-b661-4cef-ba67-caf1fde95c9b/ fetch_sra_to_fastq/ the folder corresponding to the Workflow ID you just ran. Example: 98134693-8392-4064-b8dc-af518e567e9b/ call-fastq_dl_sra/ You should now see the .fastq file associated with the Workflow. You should also see log files and other helpful output. Click on the file and copy the Terminal download command. Paste this somewhere temporary for now, as it will make our life easier shortly! 1.6 Launch Cloud Environment Create a new Jupyter analysis in the ANALYSES tab. Click the START button followed by the Jupyter button. When prompted, fill in the name as sra_analysis and click CREATE ANALYSIS. When prompted, click CREATE to launch the default cloud environment. Click on the Terminal button. After waiting a few minutes, you can see that the Cloud environment is ready. 1.7 Move Data to Persistent Disk In the Terminal, paste the command you copied from earlier and hit return. In our case, it will look like this (Yours will be different) gsutil cp gs://fc-e07a98ef-7485-4f48-bd77-d8c463867ada/submissions/c247972a-b661-4cef-ba67-caf1fde95c9b/fetch_sra_to_fastq/98134693-8392-4064-b8dc-af518e567e9b/call-fastq_dl_sra/SRR22375322_1.fastq.gz . You will see some dialog indicating that the file is downloading. type ls and hit return to list files and confirm your sequence file is present. The file can now be analyzed in your cloud environment! You just copied your file to your Persistent Disk. As long as you launch a cloud environment from this Workspace, this sequence file should be available!
